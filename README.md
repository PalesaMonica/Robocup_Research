# Robocup Research Project

This project explores **collaborative perception** in the RoboCup 3D Soccer Simulation League. It focuses on **ball perception** through agent communication and a voting-based consensus system. The aim is to improve multi-agent coordination by integrating shared perception data.

## 🧠 Key Features

- ✅ Multi-agent ball perception using agent-to-agent communication
- ✅ Voting system for consensus on ball location
- ✅ Round-based communication strategy
- ✅ Integration with the RoboCup 3D Simulation environment
- ✅ Built on top of the [FCPCodebase](https://github.com/m-abr/FCPCodebase?tab=readme-ov-file)
